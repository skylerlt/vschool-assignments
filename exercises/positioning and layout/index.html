            <h2>Civil War</h2>
            <p>Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast that includes Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, set one year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions, one led by Steve Rogers and another by Tony Stark. Development of Civil War started in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline Civil War. The Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014 after positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier. The film's title was revealed in October 2014 and Downey was added to the cast, with additional cast members joining the film in the following months. The film began principal photography in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia and the Metro Atlanta area, before concluding in Germany the following August. Captain America: Civil War held its world premiere in Los Angeles on April 12, 2016, began its international release on April 27 and was released in the United States on May 6 in 3D and IMAX 3D. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $678 million worldwide.

Approximately one year after Ultron's defeat in Sokovia at the hands of the Avengers, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rather than be captured, Rumlow blows himself up. Wanda tries to displace the blast into the sky with telekinesis, but it destroys a nearby building, killing a number of Wakandan humanitarian workers. At the team's headquarters, U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the team that the United Nations are preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the Avengers. The team is divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because he feels responsible for Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of the government. At the conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, who T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Rogers decides to bring Barnes in himself because Barnes is an old friend and the authorities plan to kill him on sight. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to his hideout in Bucharest just before a German commando team raids it. As Barnes and Rogers escape the building, they are also attacked by T'Challa, who is the superhuman Black Panther. After a destructive chase, they are all cornered and arrested. Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler and steals a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. He infiltrates the Berlin facility where Barnes is held and recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and that he is heading for the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed super-soldiers are kept in cryogenic stasis. Knowing that they will never catch Zemo in time if they wait for authorization, Rogers and Wilson decide to go rogue, and recruit Wanda, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross' permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, James Rhodes, and Vision, as well as Peter Parker, to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' team at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight. Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape with Stark's Quinjet. The rest of Rogers' team is captured, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being accidentally shot down by Vision. Romanoff is forced to go into hiding. Stark finds evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and shows this evidence to Wilson, who gives him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra base and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware he was secretly followed by T'Challa. They discover that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, whose real goal was to find proof in Hydra's archives that Barnes murdered Stark's parents in 1991. Zemo is Sokovian and wants to punish the Avengers for the death of his family by turning them against each other, and he succeeds: Stark is enraged and attacks Rogers and Barnes. Stark blasts off Barnes' robotic arm, then Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers departs with Barnes and leaves his shield behind. Satisfied that he has irreparably fractured the Avengers, Zemo attempts suicide, but T'Challa apprehends him. In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces to let him walk again, while Rogers breaks his comrades out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes and Rogers have fled to Wakanda, where T'Challa has granted them asylum. Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker tests a new gadget he received from Stark</p>
