    <p class="p1"> <b>What happens when Super Heros fight?</b>
        <br> If you've seen the recent comic book movies then you know that super heros are fighting, and sometimes it isn't pretty. Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast that includes Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, one year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, an act regulating superhuman activity fractures the Avengers into opposing factions, one led by Steve Rogers and another by Tony Stark. Development of Civil War started in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline Civil War. The Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014 after positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier. The film's title was revealed in October 2014 and Downey was added to the cast, with additional cast members joining the film in the following months. The film began principal photography in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia and the Metro Atlanta area, before concluding in Germany in August 2015. Captain America: Civil War held its world premiere in Los Angeles on April 12, 2016. It was released internationally on April 27, and is scheduled to be released in North America on May 6, in 3D and IMAX 3D.</p>

    <p class="p2"> <b>And then there were three, or four, or five donuts...</b>
        <br> Have you ever tried to put a donut back? Then you know just how difficutl it is. And eating donuts and staying fit don't exactly go together. I have been meaning to write this post for a while now and just simply haven’t gotten around to it. Lately, I have been getting a ton of inquiries about how/what I eat and how I was able to transform my body and performance because of it. If you have been following me for more than about two or three months, you have noticed the changes that my body has went through – at least physically. Maybe you have, or maybe you haven’t noticed, but those physical changes are directly correlated with changes in my performance as well. While being more than 10lbs. lighter since switching eating plans I have made some serious gains in the gym. Since regionals, I have revamped my diet and the way I look at food. until then, I guess you could say I was the classic crossfitter – I would eat “clean” (or paleo) for 6 days out of the week and on one day I would eat whatever I wanted, which was usually anything in sight. This is what I understood to be how an athlete was suppose to eat – simply because Paleo is the be all end all in the crossfit community and I thought that was what I had to be doing. What I didn’t realize was how little carbohydrates I was eating (really only sweet potatoes and fruit) and how much fat (avocados, nuts) I was eating. This is almost inevitable on a Paleo diet because it leaves you with a limited amount of carbohydrate dense foods and a ton of foods that are filled with fat. This works for some people, and I am not knocking it. I just found that personally, my body did not respond well physically, nor feel great eating this way. Before I go any further, let me explain that I was 100% pro-paleo when I was first introduced to it. I found it made me feel cleaner, healthier, and I had a new-found respect for keeping nutrient dense foods in my diet. I lost a ton of weight when I first started eating that way. In fact, when people walk into the gym and are overweight I still point them in the Paleo direction because I feel it is a great way to begin to understand food and the importance of consuming a diet that is based around protein and vegetable consumption. However, as I started exercising more vigorously, doing two a day sessions, and incorporating high volume into my training program – I became hungrier. I was still trying so hard to follow this Paleo way of eating that I was consuming an incredible amount of food to do so. In addition to the large number of protein I was consuming each day; an avocado or two in a day, handfuls of nuts, tons of bacon and eggs, all the fruit and sweet potatoes I could get my hands on was a typical day of eating. Still, I never felt like I had a great amount of energy and physically – although I was getting stronger and more muscular, I was somewhat soft and fluffy. </p>

    <p class="p3"> <b>Is it still a car if it drives for you?</b>
        <br> How do you know you can trust it? Do you trust Google every time you search for something? I can tell you I sure don't! Then how can we trust a car to drive us safetly... anywhere? Google self-driving car is any in a range of autonomous cars, developed by Google X as part of its project to develop technology for mainly electric cars. The software installed in Google's cars is named Google Chauffeur.[1] Lettering on the side of each car identifies it as a "self-driving car". The project was formerly led by Sebastian Thrun, former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and co-inventor of Google Street View. Thrun's team at Stanford created the robotic vehicle Stanley which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and its US$2 million prize from the United States Department of Defense.[2] The team developing the system consisted of 15 engineers working for Google, including Chris Urmson, Mike Montemerlo, and Anthony Levandowski who had worked on the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges.[3] Legislation has been passed in four U.S. states and Washington, D.C. allowing driverless cars. The state of Nevada passed a law on June 29, 2011, permitting the operation of autonomous cars in Nevada, after Google had been lobbying in that state for robotic car laws.[4][5] The Nevada law went into effect on March 1, 2012, and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles issued the first license for an autonomous car in May 2012, to a Toyota Prius modified with Google's experimental driverless technology.[6] In April 2012, Florida became the second state to allow the testing of autonomous cars on public roads,[7] and California became the third when Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law at Google Headquarters in Mountain View.[8] In December 2013, Michigan became the fourth state to allow testing of driverless cars on public roads.[9] In July 2014, the city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho adopted a robotics ordinance that includes provisions to allow for self-driving cars.[10] In May 2014, Google presented a new concept for their driverless car that had neither a steering wheel nor pedals,[11] and unveiled a fully functioning prototype in December of that year that they planned to test on San Francisco Bay Area roads beginning in 2015.[12] Google plans to make these cars available to the public in 2020.[13] </p>
