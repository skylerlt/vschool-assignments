Warmups  
====================

The warmups folder is a collection of the warmups we completed in class at V School. The purpose of warmups is to review and practice past material and prime us for learning new topics. Warmups are typically either quick problem-solving puzzles or small projects, and are usually completed within about 30 minutes or less.
