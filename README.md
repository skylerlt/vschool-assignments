V School Assignments  
====================

This is the main README file for all of my assignments from V School. Each of the directories in this directory represents a warmup (daily, short practices), exercise (completed immediately after learning a new topic), or a project (used to test my ability in given areas of development) that I've worked on during my time here. Each of these assignments has a README file that explains the assignment given as well as a summary of what I learned by completing the assignment.
